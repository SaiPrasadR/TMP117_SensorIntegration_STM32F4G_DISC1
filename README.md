# TMP117_SensorIntegration_STM32F4G_DISC1
In this Project the microcontroller STM32 DISCOVERY Board communicates with TMP117 as well as OLED Display via I2C protocol and Displays the Live Temperature Readings and also the High and Low temp values. When Limits get breached, alarm triggers. Also the limits can be modified via UART DMA
